## ✨ Overview

Agriculture is one of the world's oldest and most critical industries — yet crop selection remains one of its hardest decisions. Choosing the wrong crop for a given soil composition or climate can devastate an entire season's yield. Farmers often rely on passed-down knowledge or expensive consultants, with little access to data-driven guidance.

**EcoHarvest** bridges that gap.

It is a full-stack AI-powered crop recommendation web application that analyses soil nutrient levels and local climate parameters to predict the single best-suited crop for a given set of field conditions — in under a second. Built as a Project-Based Learning (PBL) submission, EcoHarvest demonstrates the real-world application of machine learning in precision agriculture.

### How it works

A user enters **7 agronomic parameters** — Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), Potassium (K), Temperature, Humidity, Soil pH, and Rainfall — into an intelligent form interface. These inputs are validated in real time against scientifically derived dataset thresholds. On submission, the values are standardised using `StandardScaler` and fed into a **Random Forest Classifier** — the champion model selected from a 3-way benchmark against XGBoost and SVM — which classifies the input against **22 crop varieties** and returns an instant recommendation.

### What makes it stand out

- 🎯 **99.32% validation accuracy** — not a toy model. Trained on 2,200 balanced samples across 22 crop classes.
- 🛡️ **Smart input validation** — out-of-range values trigger amber inline warnings and a toast notification before the request even reaches the server.
- 🖥️ **Premium multi-page UI** — a genuine production-quality interface with glassmorphism cards, aurora background animations, scroll-reveal effects, and full mobile responsiveness.
- 📊 **Transparent model reporting** — the About page includes a full breakdown of all 3 trained models with Accuracy, F1, Precision and Recall scores, animated metric bars, hyperparameter tags, and a side-by-side comparison table.
- ⚡ **Instant predictions** — a lightweight Flask REST API (`POST /api/predict`) serves predictions with no page reloads, making integration straightforward.

EcoHarvest is designed to show that machine learning is not just a backend task — the quality of the user interface, the robustness of data validation, and the transparency of model reporting are equally important in delivering a trustworthy AI product.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ecoharvest.git
cd ecoharvest
```
